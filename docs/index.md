    details: |
      Zap packs all data into buffers to send over the network.
      This has the obvious benefits of reduced bandwidth usage, however the serialization and deserialization process is typically quite slow.
      Zap generates code for your specific types which makes this process blazingly fast.
  - title: Complex Types
    icon: 🔎
    details: While buffers may only support a small number of types, Zap has complex type support.
